# Research review for contributors

Follow the [mathematical research review protocol](PROTOCOL.md), version 1.1, for mathematical claims, constructions, computations and repairs. This directory contains the complete standalone protocol. The [audit-history protocol](../audit-history/PROTOCOL.md) explains the repository's existing contracts, findings records and checks.

## Enforcement status

The live [public repository ruleset](https://github.com/elliotglazer/diophantine-z-q/rules/26781429) and [private repository ruleset](https://github.com/elliotglazer/private-diophantine/rules/26781446) are authoritative for current enforcement. Before treating a merge as protocol-gated, confirm that the applicable ruleset requires `Protocol / independent agent audit` from the designated GitHub App and that it passes for the exact revision. Existing CI alone is insufficient. This document does not assert that the App requirement is already active.

The App check must bind its decision to the reviewed repository, PR, base, head and merge revisions, evidence manifests and audit history. Contributor-written reviewer names, acceptance flags or receipts cannot authorize that check. Trusted observations and policy are managed separately. A check records an evaluation cutoff; it does not promise instantaneous detection of later comments or an atomic comment-and-merge transaction.

The [current review record](../audit-history/current.json) states the manuscript's existing scope and inherited qualifications. Installing this protocol does not expand that scope or retroactively certify the complete proof.

## Evidence to include in a PR

Link repository-relative evidence files and identify the exact commit and SHA-256 hashes reviewed. Include uncommitted evidence explicitly while preparing the packet, then bind the final committed revision. Keep secrets, local absolute paths and unrelated private material out of the packet.

1. Trace each claimed result to internal proofs and identified published theorems. Record the publication venue, authoritative version, statement, definitions and corrections actually used. Supply project proofs for needed unpublished inputs. State unresolved assumptions instead of claiming complete verification.
2. Inventory every cited application and substantive uncited external input. For each, address all [nine application obligations](PROTOCOL.md#the-nine-application-obligations), including conventions, connecting maps, exceptional cases and the precise downstream object. Have a reviewer check the inventory for omissions.
3. Supply explicit constructions and computations. Record domains, simultaneous parameter choices, algorithms, constants, exact inputs, certificates, checker commands and reproducible outputs. Distinguish a generator or compressed representation from a full expansion, and a finite identity check from its arithmetic application.
4. Register every received human or model audit and every substantive objection in the findings ledger, including unfavorable reports and comments on closed issues. Link each finding to a reviewed repair or an independently checked rebuttal. Preserve unresolved findings and earlier verdicts; a majority vote or silence does not resolve an objection.
5. Repeat independent review, repair and integration until the final frozen revision meets the protocol's [closure test](PROTOCOL.md#final-closure-review). Recheck changed premises, affected consumers and computations after each substantive repair. Obtain an independent review of the assembled proof, rather than inferring completion from component approvals.

For a documentation-only or infrastructure PR, identify the unaffected mathematical claims and explain which obligations do not apply. A PR can report incomplete work honestly; it must not mark an unreviewed argument as accepted or a finding as resolved.

## Independent review and exact versions

An application author cannot independently accept that application. Record reviewer identity, whether the reviewer is human or a model, the model and task identity when known, tools, reviewed files and scope. Unknown model metadata must remain unknown. Another run by the same agent is a repeat check. If a reviewer supplies a substantive repair, obtain a different non-author review of that repair.

Review the primary statements and actual manuscript argument, including their consumers. Compare publication versions, errata, coefficient rings, bases, signs, valuations and all other relevant conventions. Check that the manuscript edition, build target, PDF, artifacts, inventory and release manifest name the same revision. Preserve historical editions. Version 13 and later manuscript subtitles have no trailing period.

An acceptance covers only its exact bound files, sources, edits and dependencies. Further changes require a reviewer-authored decision for the new binding. Even an editorial change needs an explicit acknowledgment after comparison; it need not trigger a full mathematical audit when the comparison establishes that the mathematics is unaffected. Do not refresh accepted hashes merely to make a checker pass.

## Checks and final handoff

Run the focused checks relevant to the change. The existing audit-history check and its rejection tests are:

```sh
python -B scripts/check_audit_history.py --self-test
```

Run this command from the repository root. Include its result and limitations in the PR. The [research-checks workflow](../../.github/workflows/research-checks.yml) lists the existing computational and build checks; a small documentation change does not require running every heavy job locally.

Before final acceptance, freeze the assembled revision and record its exact changes, review decisions, findings dispositions and reproduction results. New changes or substantive objections reopen affected obligations. Keep the proof's mathematical status separate from coverage and execution status: structural checks cannot establish complete source coverage, honest independent reasoning or mathematical truth. Publication remains a separate maintainer decision.
