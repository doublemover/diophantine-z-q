## Change and scope

Describe the problem, resulting statement or behavior, and affected claims and consumers. State whether this changes mathematics, evidence, computation, documentation or infrastructure.

## Review evidence

Follow the [contributor review guide](https://github.com/elliotglazer/diophantine-z-q/blob/main/docs/research-review/README.md) and [full protocol](https://github.com/elliotglazer/diophantine-z-q/blob/main/docs/research-review/PROTOCOL.md). Link evidence for each applicable item; explain any item that does not apply. Do not mark incomplete work as accepted.

- Exact revision, file hashes, proposed edits and dependency impact:
- Complete proof and published-source application inventory, including the nine obligations and version/convention comparisons:
- Explicit construction or computational specification, certificates, reproduction commands and results:
- Non-author review decisions with exact bindings, identities and scope:
- All received audits and findings, reviewed resolutions and remaining objections:
- Final integration/closure review, or the work still needed before closure:

## Validation and limits

List checks run, their results and what they establish. Report `python -B scripts/check_audit_history.py --self-test` when relevant. Identify unrun checks and unresolved assumptions.

Check the live [public ruleset](https://github.com/elliotglazer/diophantine-z-q/rules/26781429) or [private ruleset](https://github.com/elliotglazer/private-diophantine/rules/26781446) for current enforcement. A protocol-gated merge requires `Protocol / independent agent audit` from the designated App to be required and passing for the exact revision; existing green CI alone is insufficient. This template does not assert that requirement is already active or retroactively certify a proof. Further changes require renewed review; do not update acceptance hashes on behalf of reviewers.
